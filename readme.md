## My process
My process of building this project is the first I will create the design for desktop version with HTML, CSS and then I will check for breakpoints for smaller screens and make it responsible, then at last I will use Vanilla Javascript for the logic and event handling. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Session Storage


### What I learned
This project offers a lot of new stuff to learn, with this project the new thing that I learn is to update the lightbox on clicking the add to cart button. I also faced many bugs while working with counter, the value was get updating but it was not showing in the counter label, then after minor changes it worked.
